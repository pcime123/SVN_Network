Implementation of jNetStream LiveCapture interfaces. This package
provides a concrete implementation defined by LiveCapture API. The
implementation is based on jNetPcap platform dependent capture library
that is a wrapper around libpcap and WinPcap native libraries. The
LiveCapture implementation is implemented as a separate module, so that
it can be completely decoupled from the main jNetStream implementation.
This allows LiveCapture to be excluded from certain deployments, when
live captures are not necessary.

<P>A network protocol registry. You can access various protocol related services using this package.
This package is responsible for finding and loading protocol definitions and their bindings. The runtime
environment uses the ProtocolRepository to query about protocol bindings. Only protocols that
are needed at any given time are loaded (ondemand protocol loading.) Thus jNetStream is much more
efficient as only parts of the protocols are loaded when needed. All protocols once loaded are
cached and are reused when needed again.</P>

<P>The main class is the ProtocolRegistry which allows a user to access most of the functionality. Using 
the ProtocolRegistry.getDefault() factory method, you get a working instance of the ProtocolRegistry which
you can use to:
<UL>
 <LI> Query for a list of all the known protocols. The list will contain protocols currently know, but not
 neccessarily loaded. Protocols are loaded only when needed, otherwise only a shell of a protocol is kept around.
 <LI> Query for a list of bindings for the protocols.
 <LI> Load user specified bindings. Bindings can also be unloaded and reset by the user. Again using methods
 defined in ProtocolRegistry.
</UL>
</P>

<P>jNetStream also defines a number of standard names for protocol suites. Protocol suite is a way to group all
of the defined protocols by functionality. These protocol suite definitions actually correspond to directory
structure in native filesystem or database by which all the protocol definitions are grouped. Also jNetStream
expects protocol binding definitions to be placed in suite specific files. User defined suites are not
part of this API, as this API only exposes the system defined suites. There is a large number of them which
for the most part will address any protocol placement needs, but user can also define its own definitions as long
as they do not conflict with these system defined ones.</P>

<P>To get a list of these system defined suites use the ProtocolSuite enum class. In pre Java5 environments this class
defines all of the standard Java5 enum API and is upwards compatible. This means that the user is safe in using the
ProtocolSuite API in both pre and post Java5 environments without getting compiler warnings or errors.</P>

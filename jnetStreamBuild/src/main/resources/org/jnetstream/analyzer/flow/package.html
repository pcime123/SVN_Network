<P>Packet flow analyzer. The analyzer can analyze incomming packets and group them
into a natural flows. Packets are grouped into flows according to FlowKey criteria.
A FlowKey determines the fields within the packet which are significant and
are used for grouping other packets with similar matching keys. In the end, the
grouped packets are returned as PacketFlow object, which contains the
grouped packets.</P>

<P>The flow keys are defined within the NPL definition of a protocol. Therefore
each protocol can define its own set of criteria, within a flow key, for
grouping similar packets together.</P>

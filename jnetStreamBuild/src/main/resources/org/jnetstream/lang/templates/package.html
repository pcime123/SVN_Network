<p>
This package contains ANTLR's String Template interface files which define
exact requirements for string template group files for various kinds of
output types. The files with extension <code>.sti</code> are all String Template
Interface files written in String Template Interfarce syntax 
{@link http://www.stringtemplate.org}.
</p>
The files within this package contain signatures of the required templates to
generate the appropriate type of file, as described in summary below:
<ul>
<li> Binding.sti - binding output.</li>
<li> Filter.sti - filter output that implements <code>Filter</code> java interface
or similar such required in non java context.</li>
<li> Expression.sti - a generic expression that evaluates to an integer. The
expression is run against the packet buffer, similar how the filter is run, but
the Java interface implemented is <code>Expression</code> and something similar
in non java context.</li>
<li> Stub.sti - generates a comprehensive java stub interface file containing all
the accessors and runtime interfaces as generated when NPL header definition is 
compiled.</li>
<li>StubImpl.sti - similar to Stub.sti with the exception that java class file
are generated that implement the interfaces generated by Stub.sti.</li>
<li> Codec.sti - generates concrete class that implements <code>HeaderCodec</code>
and adds any appropriate logic and code from source NPL definition.</li>
</ul>

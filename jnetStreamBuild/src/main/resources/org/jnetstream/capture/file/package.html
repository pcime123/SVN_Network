<P>A capture file manipulation package. There a number of capture file formats 
that are used to store captured packets inside a file. This package allows detailed access
and traversal of the structure of each of these files.</P>

<P>The package provides a base set of interfaces for accessing the detailed structure of a
capture file, further detail with supplied interfaces is supplied with the file definition
itself in jnetpcap.file.type package. At this level within the API, some amount of knowledge
about the file structure is needed. The amount is detail required is still small compared
to the actual complexity of some of the file formats. The section below describes the
abstracted representation of the capture file structure used by this package.</P>

<h3>Representation of capture file structure</h3>
<P>The structure of each capture file, as presented by this package is as follows:
<UL> 
 <LI> A capture file may contain 1 or more BlockRecords, sometimes also referred to
 as "file header". The BlockRecord usually contains information about the block such as
 unique ID field called the "Magic Pattern" or "Magic Number", block version information
 and some other meta information. For example Pcap and Snoop files contain only a single
 BlockRecord, but Nap file type usually contains more than one.
 
 <LI> A BlockRecord contains 0 or more DataRecords. BlockRecord is not of type DataRecord
 and thus may not be contained within another BlockRecord. The most common type of DataRecord
 is a PacketRecord, but other types exist as well for other formats. 
</UL>

<p>A high performance network packet capture framework. This is a
high level packet capture framework that abstracts all of the complexity
of live network captures, reading captured packets from capture files
(trace files), streaming packet data accross java.io streams or enabling
remote capture sesssion accross the network. The <code>org.jnetstream.capture</code>
package allows easy processing and capture of network packets. Live
packets can be captured on a local network interface or remotely.</p>

<p>The main class you will be dealing with is the <code>Capture</code>
interface. You aquire a reference to a <code>Capture</code> instance
using factory methods in the <code>Captures</code> class for local
sessions and <code>RemoteSession</code> for, you guessed it, remote
sessions on a remote server. (To get a <code>RemoteSession</code> call
the static method <code>RemoteServer.openSession(URI)</code> .) The
factory methods return the most specific subclass of <code>LiveCapture</code>
and <code>FileCapture</code>, all of which are subclasses of the base <code>Capture</code>
interface. So remember that <code>LiveCapture</code> and <code>FileCapture</code>
both extend <code>Capture</code>. You will see in the examples below the
use of <code>Capture</code> and sometimes the more specific subclass
depending if the method involved in the example need something out of
the more specific subclass such as <code>LiveCapture.interfaceSnapshot()</code>
method (see section "<code>CaptureInterface</code> state changes"
below.)</p>

<p><code>CapturePacket</code> is a high level object that holds a
buffer with packet data as captured from a live network interface, a
file or remote sender. It also contains some additional information
needed for proper processing of the buffer. Also contains some meta data
such as capture timestamp, a reference to the CaptureDevice which holds
detailed descriptors about the network interface that the packet was
captured on.</p>

<h3>Getting started, aquiring a Capture instance</h3>
<p>The Captures class provides the following static factory methods
which instantiate capture sessions:
<ul>
	<li><code>Captures.openFile(File)</code> - opens up a capture file
	for reading</li>

	<li><code>Captures.openLive(NetworkInterface)</code> - opens up a
	network interface for live capture from the network</li>

	<li><code>Captures.openFile(InputStream)</code> - opens up a
	capture from a stream, but exects the stream to be in supported file
	format such as when you use a FileInputStream on a capture file.</li>

	<li><code>CaptureInputStream</code> - this is a class that
	deserializes <code>CapturePacket</code> written to a <code>CaptureOutputStream</code>.
	Both these classes are subclasses of <code>InputStream</code> and <code>OutputStream</code>.
	Passing a <code>CaptureInputStream</code> to <code>Captures.openFile(InputStream)</code>
	method will throw an <code>CaptureFormatException</code> since the
	stream is not formatted to like capture files.</li>
</ul>

And many many more variations of the above.
</p>
<h3>Reading from a <code>Capture</code> instance</h3>
Next you will want get the packets from a capture session. The
<code>Capture</code>
interaface extends the
<code>IOIterator</code>
interface which uses the familiar
<code>hasNext()</code>
and
<code>next()</code>
method calls. So lets just open a live capture on all network interfaces
a system has and print the packet properties to stdout:

<pre>
Capture capture = Captures.openLive(); // Opens up all network interfaces, except loopback ints
while (capture.hasNext()) {
	CapturePacket packet = capture.next();
	System.out.println("packet properties=" + packet.toString());
}
</pre>
<b>Note:</b>
Note that you also need to catch some exceptions that are declared, but
not included in the example.

<h3>Capturing packets from live network interface and storing them
in a capture file</h3>
<p>Another common usage is to capture packets and store them in a
file.</p>
<p>So we first setup a source of packets which is a live network
capture from a specific network interface.
<pre>
List&lt;CaptureDevice&gt; ints = Captures.listInterfaces();
if (ints.isEmpty()) {
	return; // No interfaces on this system
}
CaptureInterface netint = ints.get(0); // Just grab the first network interface
Capture capture = Captures.openLive(netint);
</pre>
So now we have a source of packets which is the first network interface
returned all the interfaces. Next we want to create a new file and
append all the captured packets to that file. We will create the file in
PCAP format.
<pre>
Captures.newFile(new File("mycapture.pcap", SuppliedFileTypes.PCAP, capture);
</pre>
The above line creates a new file called "mycapture.pcap" in PCAP format
(2nd parameter). At this point all the needed initialization is done and
a new file created with the right file header. The the last argument is
the source of packets, our capture instance. The above method iterates
through all the way to the end using {@link Capture#hasNext()} and
{@link Capture#next()} method calls until hasNext eventually returns
false. Those packets are written in the PCAP format into the capture
file.
</p>
<h1>Filtering</h1>
Filtering of packets being captured or read from a file is another
common operation. Filtering involves creating a Filter object and using
one of the factory methods that takes a filter. Most methods have
varioutions of a call that does take a filter. Lets modify our above
example and use a filter to only capture IP packets.

<pre>
List&lt;CaptureDevice&gt; ints = Captures.listInterfaces();
if (ints.isEmpty()) {
	return; // No interfaces on this system
}
CaptureDevice netint = ints.get(0); // Just grab the first network interface
Filter filter = new BpfFilter(new PcapExpression("ip"));
Capture capture = Captures.openLive(filter, netint);
</pre>

<p>The filter is a BPF filter (Berkley Packet Filter) that
efficiently filters incomming packets being captured and only allows
packets that match the filter criteria to be returned. The filter is
actually applied to operating system kernel (if OS supports this option)
and the packet capture driver efficiently filters packets without any
extraneous copies of packet contents. Lastly the filter is simply
supplied as the first parameter to the openLive method.</p>

<p>An alternate way to set a filter is to set the filter on the
CaptureDevice. Such as in this case:
<pre>
List&lt;CaptureDevice&gt; ints = Captures.listInterfaces();
if (ints.isEmpty()) {
	return; // No interfaces on this system
}
CaptureDevice netint = ints.get(0); // Just grab the first network interface
Filter filter = new BpfFilter(new PcapExpression("ip"));
netint.setFilter(filter);
Capture capture = Captures.openLive(netint);
</pre>
</p>

<p>This sets the filter only on this interface and not any other
interfaces if they were specified. You can also change the filter after
the capture has begun and even some packets returned. The only way to
change a filter after the CaptureInterface has been applied, is to set
it on the capture itself and not on the device instance directly.
<pre>
List&lt;CaptureDevice&gt; ints = Captures.listInterfaces();
if (ints.isEmpty()) {
	return; // No interfaces on this system
}
CaptureDevice netint = ints.get(0); // Just grab the first network interface
Filter ipFilter = new BpfFilter(new PcapExpression("ip"));
netint.setFilter(ipFilter);
Capture capture = Captures.openLive(netint);

// Get 10 IP packets
for (int i = 0; i < 10 && capture.hasNext(); i ++) {
  System.out.println("CaptureInstance=" + capture.next().getCaptureInterface());
}

// After netint has been applied it becomes immutable and we can no longer call
// on its CaptureDevice.setFilter method. Use CaptureInterface.isMutable() to check for this.

Filter ipxFilter = new BpfFilter(new JpcapExpression("ipx"));
CaptureInterface ni = capture.setFilter(filter, netint); // Sets a new filter and creates a new instance of CaptureInterface

// Get 10 IPX packets
for (int i = 0; i < 10 && capture.hasNext(); i ++) {
  System.out.println("CaptureInstance=" + capture.next().getCaptureInterface());
}

capture.close();
</pre>

The call to
<code>capture.setFilter(filter, netint)</code>
does not modify the netint instance, this instance is immutable after
the call to Captures.openLive(netint). What happens is a new instance of
CaptureInterface is created based on the old one, and the new filter set
in the new instance. The call returns the new CaptureInstance reference,
notice its no longer returned as CaptureDevice as its immediately
applied to captures and becomes immutable. The reason for this strict
mutable/immutable control is that any perviously captured packets will
still reference the same CaptureInterface reference at the time they
were captured. New packets returned after the new filter was applied to
filter on IPX packets, will return references to new CaptureInterface
that has the new filter applied.
</p>


<h1>Appending captured packets to an existing file</h1>
<p>To append packets to an existing file you need to first get your
source of packets setup, open up the capture file and use the methods in
MutableFileCapture or simply call a utility method in <code>Captures.append()</code>
to do the copying for you. This time lets use a NAP file and do the
copying ourselves:
<pre>
Capture capture = Captures.openLive(); // Opens up all network interfaces, except loopback
MutableCaptureFile file = CaptureFiles.openFile(new File("mycapture.nap");
file.last(); // advance the iterator to past the last packet in the file

while (capture.hasNext()) {
	CapturePacket packet = capture.next();
	file.add(packet);
}
</pre>
First we create a new capture which opens up all the network interfaces
for live capture. Second we open a NAP file. Third we advance the file
position to the end of the file by calling {@link
MutableFileCapture#last} which returns the last packet and advances the
position past it. We want to append our packets to the end not insert
them at the beginning although for an empty file beginning is the last
element. Lastly we go into a loop that reads one packet at a time and
using the mutable file adds or appends the packets to the file.
</p>
<p>We could have done steps 3 and 4 with a utility method. Here is
the same example using the utility method:
<pre>
Capture capture = Captures.openLive(); // Opens up all network interfaces
CaptureFile file = CaptureFiles.openFile(new File("mycapture.nap"));
CaptureFiles.append(file, capture);
</pre>

Or this compact notation:
<pre>
CaptureFiles.catFile(new File("mycapture.nap"), Captures.openLive());
</pre>

<h3>CaptureInterface state changes</h3>
<p>It is certainly possible for a network interface on which a
capture is taking place to change state such as different set of
LiveCapture.Option has been set by a separate instance of LiveCapture,
someone had alterned the IP addresses assigned to the interface at
runtime, a new filter applied, etc etc... All the while our capture
session is still in progress. There is a simple way to record these
changes by taking a <b>snapshot</b> of the interface config. After a
snapshot is taken any packets returned will reference new
CaptureInterface objects that reflect the exact config of the interface,
while any previously returned packets will continue to reference the old
CaptureInterface objects which contain the state before the snapshot
took place. To take a snapshot simply call the
LiveCapture.interfaceSnapshot method.
<pre>
LiveCapture capture = Captures.openLive();
for (int i = 0; i < 10000 && capture.hasNext(); i ++) {
  LivePacket packet = capture.next();
  // Do something with the packet
}

// Some even caused one of the interface to change state, i.e. new IP address alias added to the interface
capture.interfaceSnapshot();

// Now capture 10000 more packets which reference new CaptureInterface objects
for (int i = 0; i < 10000 && capture.hasNext(); i ++) {
  LivePacket packet = capture.next();
  // Do something with the packet
}

capture.close();
</pre>

The call to interfaceSnapshot() creates new CaptureInterface instances
on all currently open interfaces. The new CaptureInterfaces are
initialized to the latest state of the network interface, reflecting the
fact that new IP address alias has been added to one network interfaces.
You could more specifically target the exact interface instead of taking
a snapshot of all interface by using the variation of the method
interfaceSnapshot(CaptureInterface).
</p>

<p><b>Note that using the Capture.setFilter method to set a new
filter automatically takes a snapshot to reflect the changed filter. It
is not required to take a second snapshot by explicitely calling another
interfaceSnapshot.</b></p>

<h3>Static factory vs. abstract factory and working with
RemoteSession objects</h3>
All the above examples have used the static factory methods of Captures
class. There is another way by using the abstract factory methods of
Captures.LocalFactory and Captures.RemoteFactory interface methods both
of which extend the common Captures.Factory, super interface. The static
Captures methods are delegate methods that simply call on the default
Captures.LocalFactory instance. You can use the Captures.getLocal()
method to aquire a reference to the main factory that does all the work.
To get a reference to the RemoteFactory reference you call on
RemoteServer.openSession method which returns RemoteSession which is
simply a subclass of the RemoteFactory interface.
<pre>
List&lt;CaptureDevice&gt; ints;
LiveCapture live;
FileCapture file;

Captures.LocalFactory lf = Captures.getLocal();
ints = lf.listInterfaces(); // List of all interfaces on local system
live = lf.openLive();                        // Open all interfaces on local system for capture
file = lf.openFile(new File("myfile.pcap")); // Open file on local system for reading and writting
live.close();
file.close();

Captures.RemoteFactory rf = RemoteServer.openSession(new URI("192.168.1.1"));
ints = rf.listInterfaces();                              // List of all interfaces on remote system
live = rf.openLive();                                    // Open all interfaces on remote system for capture
file = rf.openFile(new File("/tmp/myfile.pcap"));        // Open file on remote system for reading and writting

live.close();
file.close();
</pre>

Or even more abstracted since all these above methods are actually in
the super interface Captures.Factory:

<pre>
List&lt;CaptureDevice&gt; ints;
LiveCapture live;
FileCapture file;
Captures.Factory factory;

factory = Captures.getLocal();
ints = factory.listCaptureDevices();                        // List of all interfaces on local system
live = factory.openLive();                              // Open all interfaces on local system for capture
file = factory.openFile(new File("myfile.pcap"));       // Open file on local system for reading and writting
live.close();
file.close();

RemoteSession session = RemoteServer.openSession(new URI("192.168.1.1"));
factory = session;                                      // RemoteSession extends RemoteFactory     
ints = factory.listCaptureDevices();                        // List of all interfaces on remote system
live = factory.openLive();                              // Open all interfaces on remote system for capture
file = factory.openFile(new File("/tmp/myfile.pcap"));  // Open file on remote system for reading and writting

live.close();
file.close();
session.close(); // We needed to keep RemoteSession reference only so that we could explicitly close it
                 // because RemoteFactory itself is not Closeable. 

</pre>

You get the point. There is not much difference in invoking factory
methods for local or remote sessions. There are some restrictions and
they are reflected in methods included in the <code>LocalFactory</code> and
<code>RemoteFactory</code> interfaces. Certain methods that can only be invoked
locally are not included in the RemoteFactory and vise versa. The above
example assumes that you have an instance of RemoteServer running on the
remote system at IP address 192.168.1.1. It should be clear at this
point that the static <code>Captures</code> methods are only defined for all
<code>LocalFactory</code> abstract methods. <code>RemoteSession</code> itself adds a few
additional methods related to a remote session besides the methods
extended from <code>RemoteFactory</code>.
</p>

<h3>Creating a new file and inserting customized records</h3>
<p>Another thing you may wish to do, is to actually control all the
parameters of a capture file. So lets do an example of where we create a
Pcap file with a custom block record (file header).</p>
<p>There are actually several ways to create an empty file in
jNetStream capture framework.
<ul>
	<li>Use the <code>Captures</code> static methods</li>
	<pre>
PcapFile pcap = Captures.newFile(FileType.Pcap, new File("capture.pcap"));
</pre>
	<li>Aquire the current <code>Factory</code> for local sessions and use its
	factory methods</li>
	<pre>
LocalFactory lf = Captures.getLocal();
PcapFile pcap = lf.newFile(FileType.Pcap, new File("capture.pcap"));
</pre>
	<li>For known file types, use its convenience method to create a
	new file</li>
	<pre>
PcapFile pcap = FileType.Pcap.newFile(File("capture.pcap"));
</pre>
</ul>

Once we have a Pcap capture file we can proceed to tweak its contents.
By default the capture file is created with a <code>PcapBlockRecord</code> already in
place with default values, there is no way to create a file without
these defaults. But its easy to clear out the file to its absolute
minimum.

<pre>
PcapFile pcap = FileType.Pcap.newFile("capture.pcap"):
PcapModifier modifier = pcap.getPcapIterator();
modifier.removeAllRecords();
</pre>
At this point the file size is 0 bytes, all records have been completely
removed. We can then proceed to add our custom block record with our new
values:
<pre>
PcapFile pcap = FileType.Pcap.newFile("capture.pcap"):
PcapModifier modifier = pcap.getPcapIterator();
modifier.removeAllRecords();

PcapBlockRecord block = modifier.addBlockRecord(
	new byte[] {0x11, 0x22, 0x33, 0x44}, // Magic Number
	2, 4,                                // Major and minor verions
	PcapDLT.EN10,                        // DLT
	0,                                   // Accuracy
	0,                                   // Timezone
	1024                                 // Snaplen
);
</pre>
We're convieniently returned a reference to the newly created block
record. We can then proceed to add packet records which is the only
other type of record a Pcap file can have using
<code>PcapModifier.addPacketRecord()</code>
method. Notice that we added a bogus magic number, which the API allowed
us to do. This creates an invalid pcap file that no program could read
in, but if that's what the user wanted to do, its allowed.
</p>
<p>The other file formats, especially NAP file formats are a lot
more involved with many different types of records possible and their
Modifiers are much more comprehensive.
<pre>
NapFile nap = FileType.Nap.newFile("capture.nap");
NapModifier modifier = nap.getNapIterator();
/* 
 * Now, using the NapModifier, we can add block, property, capture device, packet records.
 * NapModifier allows addition of over a dozen different types of NAP records.
 */
</pre>
You get the point.
</p>
<h3>Efficiency</h3>
<p><code>Factory</code> methods may be much more efficient at copying packets
around as more efficient algorithms may be used to accomplish the task
then simply iterating one packet at a time. For example if you were
appending PCAP file as sources to a destination file that was also a
PCAP file, then raw bulk buffers of source file data may be copied at
once, without the need to even do the minimal decoding that is done when
packets are iterated over. Or if the destination file was a PCAP file
and the source <code>LiveCapture</code> was also based on libpcap implementation (as
it is, part of the first release) the much more efficient offline
capture would be initiated which uses kernel drivers to dump packets
directly into the destination capture file; a much more efficient short
cut indeed. So the capture framework will pick the most efficient
algorithm available for the circumstances at hand.</p>

<p>The capture framework uses <code>java.nio</code> package extensively to
allocate large direct buffers, map file contents into memory using
native OS shortcuts and then, decodes only the smallest amount of data
needed to accomplish the task. The objects returned such as
CapturePacket and its subclassed variations reference into these buffers
and don't typically allocate a lot of memory themselves. This means
these objects can be created efficiently. Multiple packets are typically
prefetched into a cache in larger chunks and share a single large
buffer. Some buffers map file contents directly into buffer's memory
ensuring that the file contents are only read into memory once; by the
kernel.</p>

<p>Also use the methods that take entire collections instead of
accomplishing the same task by using methods that take a single element
and you doing the iteration. This is especially true when modifying
files or inserting/deleting packets from files. The implementation
algorithms are tuned for executing operations as efficiently as possible
given all the information supplied. So inserting or deleting a bunch of
packets at once in a file is much more efficient then inserting or
deleting a single packet at a time. The same is true for all methods
that accept collections or arrays.</p>

<p>Future enhancements may provide additional efficiencies as
technologies develop and this project matures. The API is designed to
hide the implementation details well and allows a lot of leaverage for
the implementors to do their magic behind the scenes.</p>

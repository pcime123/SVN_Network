<P>A network packet API. This package defines the API for accessing
packet buffer, decoding its contents and modifying its state. The main interface is the Packet
interface which provides top level access to each captured packet. Using
the Packet interface, you can access the raw packet buffer which contains
the sequence of octets that make up the contents of the packet. You can
manipulate those buffer contents using high level accessor and setter methods,
insert, remove and copy buffer contents around. <P>
<B>Example: accessing packet's buffer content directly and then using high level
API for which Packet interface is the superclass:
<PRE>
LiveCapture capture = CaptureFactory.openLive();

while (capture.hasNext()) {
  Packet packet = capture.next();
  
  ByteBuffer rawBuffer = packet.getBuffer();
  // Check and make sure buffer has packet data
  if (rawBuffer.limit() == 0) {
    return; // Empty buffer
  }
  
  /*
   * Next lets call on higher level API to decode the contents of the buffer.
   * The IPv4 interface is auto generated from the related NPL definition. It 
   * provides full access to the structure of the IP header. All data returned
   * is backed by the back-end rawBuffer returned earlier. Any changes to
   * the rawBuffer, are also reflected by the returned values from the higher
   * level API. If the packet structure is altered significantly, Packet.update()
   * must be called as well.
   */
  if (packet.hasCompleteHeader(IPv4.class)) {
    IPv4 ip = packet.getHeader(IPv4.class);
    System.out.println("IP header version = " + ip.version());
    System.out.println("IP header flags = " + ip.flags());
  }
}
</PRE>

<h2>Creating new packets</h2>
Creating new packets is easy. The package provides a static factory called 
<code>Packets</code> for
creating an empty packet that can easily be populated with headers and data.

<pre>
Packet packet = Packet.newPacket();
packet.addAll(Ethernet2.class, IPv4.class, TCP.class);
</pre>

The above example creates a new empty packet and then adds to the packet
3 headers, Ethernet2, IPv4 and TCP. Each header is initialized to its defaults.
To aid in further initializing the packets can be initialized to a known state
using CaptureDevice, java.util.Properties or another packet using one of the
flavours of <code>initFrom</code> method call. 
<pre>
CaptureDevice device = Captures.deviceList().get(0);

Packet packet = Packet.newPacket(Ethernet2.class, IPv4.class, TCP.class);
packet.initSource(device);

IPv4 ip = packet.getHeader(IPv4.class);
ip.destination(IPv4.BROADCAST);
</pre>
First we acquire the first network interface for our system. Next we create
a new packet with Ethernet2, IPv4 and TCP headers initialized to their defaults
and bound to each other. Next we allow each header to pull properties out of the
CaptureDevice to initialize any source parameters. This would be IPv4.source
 and Ethernet2.source fields in those headers. Destination fields stay at
 their defaults which is all zeroed out. Next we set the IPv4.destionation
 field to value of a IPv4.BROADCAST which equates to 255.255.255.255. Now we
 have a properly configured packet that we can transmit out a network
 interface or save to a file.

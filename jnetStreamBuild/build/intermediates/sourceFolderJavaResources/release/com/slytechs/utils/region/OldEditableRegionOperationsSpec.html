<h1>Region Operations Specification</h1>
This section defines in detail all the operations that are possible on a
region and its effects on the internal structure of region and resulting
segments. The section is extremely detailed since regions are such an
important component of any editing implementations. The region behaviour
is extensively documented in this document so that all results can be
very predictable and testable for expected outcome.
<h2>Regions and Segments</h2>
Region is an arbitrary sequence of elements. It is not defined what the
elments are and in reality its not important from region's perspective
what that is. A region maintains which portions of the region are
active or inactive and from those two sources of information its able to
generate usable address space which is returned as a sequence of
segments.
<br>
Each segment simply specifies which portion of the region are usable by
supplying several properties about the segment of the region being
describes. Those properties are
<ul>
	<li>start - the index of the first element within the region</li>
	<li>length - number of elements within this segment</li>
	<li>last - the index of the last element within the region</li>
	<li>end - the index of the first element past the last element.
	End index is outside the boundary of the segment and is not contained
	within it.</li>
	<li>region reference - a reference to parent region</li>
</ul>
A region has the following properties:
<ul>
	<li>start is always 0, so no official start property is defined</li>
	<li>length is immutable and has the number of elements in the
	region</li>
	<li>list of segments - a list of all the segments for this region</li>
	<li>user data - a generic data argument which can be anything</li>
</ul>

All regions are immutable. This may be counter intuitive concept, but
what happens is that once a region is created its start or length
properties can never be changed. Although you are allowed to make
mutable operations such as insert, remove and replace, what you are
actually doing is adding new regions which change how things look
externally, but in reality the region elements are never touched. They
are simply either left as is or mapped out of the usable address space,
but in reality they still exist.

<h2>Regions</h2>
Regions are crucial components of the entire EditableRegion and form a
hierarchy of portions of a regions and sub-regions which have been
replaced. Regions are partial regions that replace portions of a parent
region. All operations performed on main EditableRegion result in a new
region being generated and applied to a parent region to generate the
required outcome.
<ul>
	<li>Remove operations use regions to replace a certain portion of
	a parent region with a new 0 length region, resulting in effectively
	the replaced/removed parts of the parent region being mapped out of
	usable space and effectively removed.</li>

	<li>Insert operations use regions to replace 0 amount of parent
	region with a new region that has length greater then 0. In effect no
	portion of the parent region is replaced, but a new region is inserted
	at the requested position.</li>

	<li>Replace operations both replace a certain amount of parent
	region with new region that actually has length.</li>

	<li>Lastly append operation insert is a little different since the
	append operation requires new element to be added past the last element
	within a region and note that regions are immutable so its length
	actually can not be extended. The append operation works outside the
	bounds of any addressable region and is treated differently.
</ul>
<h3>Quick Example</h3>
An example will outline the concept of regions:
<pre>
       0              5    0              5             10 11 
       +--------------+    +--------------------------------+
  L2 = |aa|bb|cc|dd|ee| =&gt; | 1| 2| a|aa|bb|cc|dd|ee| c| 4| 5|
       +--------------+    +--------------------------------+
        \___      ___/
          0 \    / 3       0              5     7
          +--------+       +--------------------+
  L1 =    | a| b| c|    =&gt; | 1| 2| a| b| c| 4| 5|
          +--------+       +--------------------+
           \      /
       0    \    /    5
       +--------------+
  L0 = | 1| 2| 3| 4| 5|
       +--------------+
</pre>
<p>Layer 0 is made up of the following L0[0,4]. L0 is no longer
mutable and its elements can only be mapped out of usable address space,
but any of the operatations supported. L0 has 5 elements which are 1, 2,
3, 4, 5. Start of the region is at index 0 and last elements is at index
4, thus 0 through 4 is 5 elements total. At this point the resulting
segment is simply S0[0,4] where start=0 and last = 4.</p>
<p>In the next operation we apply L1[0,3]=(a,b,c). We replace 3rd
element at index 2 with L1. The final result after applying
L0.replace(2, 1, L1) is a 3 segments and a new view of the entire region
as follows: S0(0,1), S1(2, 4), S(5,6). Notice that the usable address
space of all 3 segments is contigeous, meaning 0,1,2,3,4,5,6, but the
segment structure breaks it up for us into usable segments. The view of
the entire result is this: View(L0.0, L0.1, L1.0, L1.1, L1.2, L0.3,
L0.4). Notice that element at L0.2 does not exist in the resultable view
as its been replaced by L1.</p>
<p>Lastly we apply L2[0,4]=(aa,bb,cc,dd,ee) with L1.replace(1, 1,
L2). Which results in the following view: View(L0.0, L0.1, L1.0, L2.0,
L2.1, L2.3, L2.4, L1.2, L0.3, L0.4). The segments simply break this view
up, well into segments as follows: s0(L0.0, L0.1), s1(L1.0),
s2(L2.0-L2.4), s3(L1.2), s4(L0.3,L0.4) which add up exactly to the view.
So the view and represented as a sequence of segments of usable
elements, the hide the complex region mapping.</p>
<h3>A more practical example</h3>
Lets take a quick look at what happends when we map a file and then we
do try and do a single operation on it to replace 2 bytes with some
other buffer.
<pre>
         0                        10,000
         +---------------~~--------+
  file = | 1| 2| 3| 4| 5|..| 10,000|
         +---------------~~--------+
</pre>
<p>First we learn that the file we are editing has exactly 100,000
bytes in it. Therefore we create the initial region of length 100,000.
The length is immutable so we can not change it after its creation. Now
if we want to replace 2 bytes at offset 3 with another buffer that
contains 3 bytes. So in essence, we are unmapping a single byte at index
3 and replacing it with 2 bytes from our own buffer. In effect, the file
length has increased by 1 byte since we removed 1 byte and added 2.</p>
<p>Since the file region is immutable, we simply overlay a new
region over the region that holds usable address space of the file. as
follows:</p>
<pre>
            0     2  
            +-----+ 
  L =       | a| b|
            +-----+
             \    |
         0    \   |              10,000
         +---------------~~--------+
  file = | 1| 2| 3| 4| 5|..| 10,000|
         +---------------~~--------+
</pre>
<p>The segments returned are s0(file.0, file.1), s1(L.0, l.1),
s2(file.3 - file.99,999)</p>
<p>Although the actual process is fairely complex, its easy to see
that it would not be very hard to work with these segments. If you
wanted to write out the new contents into some other file such as in
save operation of the changes you could use the following code, somewhat
in pseudo form:
<pre>
FileChannel file = new RandomAccessFile("testfile", "r").getChannel();
/*
 * Map the file contents to a region
 * EditableRegion(FileChannel source, long length, Object)
 */
EditableRegion&lt;Object&gt; edits = new EditableRegion&lt;Object&gt;(file, file.length(), file);

/*
 * Next replace 1 byte in file at offset 2 with 2 bytes found in the buffer
 * EditableRegion&lt;Object&gt;.replace(long start, long toBeReplacedLength, long newLength, Object)
edits.replace(2, 1, 2, char[] {'a', 'b'});

/*
 * Now return the view as an interator of segment 
 */
IOIterator&lt;RegionSegment&lt;Object&gt;&gt; i = edits.segments(); 

FileChannel out = new RandomAccesFile("dstFile", "rw").getChannel();

while (i.hasNext()) {
  RegionSegment&lt;Object&gt; s = i.next();
  
  final Object data = s.getData();
  final long start = s.getStart();  // Starting index within the data object
  final long length = s.getLength();// Number of bytes within the data object
  final long end = s.getEnd();      // Ending index within the data object
  
  if (data instanceof FileChannel) {
    FileChannel channel = (FileChannel)data;
    /* 
     * If we are the source file channel use file channel ops to efficiently 
     * copy the contents. The segment tells us exactly which section of the
     * file to copy from the channel
     */
    out.transferFrom(start, length, channel);
    
  } else {
    byte[] b = (byte[])o;
    
    /*
     * Copy the byte array 1 byte at a time, as an example.
     */
    for (int i = start; i &lt; end; i ++) {
      out.put(b[i]);
    }
  }
}
</pre>

Note how our initial operation on the file, modified the view of the
file and did not actually change anything within the file. The change is
only propagated after we write everything out to a new file. The new
file is missing the original byte at offset 2 and has 2 new bytes
inserted in its place.
<h2>Detailed case study of each region operations</h2>
The mappings that take place are very complex and this section outlines
each of the possible category of operations, especially the corner cases
that could possibly cause problems. These cases are also coded via jUnit
test cases to test the working of regions. Dummy regions are setup and
the operations listed in these cases are applied, the result is
thourghly checked to make sure the expected outcome is achieved.
<h3>Case 1 - Single region</h3>
Simplest test case when there is 1 region and no performed on it.
<pre>
         0  1  2  3  4  5
         +--------------+
     A = | 1| 2| 3| 4| 5|
         +--------------+
</pre>
Segments
<ol>
	<li>s0(A.0 - A.4)
</ol>

<h3>Case 2 - Single insert in the middle</h3>
<pre>
          +--+
  B =     | 1|
          +--+
           \ |
       0    \|        5
       +--------------+
  A =  | 1| 2| 3| 4| 5|
       +--------------+

</pre>
Segments
<ol>
	<li>(A.0 - A.1)</li>
	<li>(B.0)</li>
	<li>(A.2 - A.4)</li>
</ol>

<h3>Case 3 - Single insert in the front</h3>
<pre>
    +--+
 B =| 1|
    +--+
     \ |
      \|              5
       +--------------+
  A =  | 1| 2| 3| 4| 5|
       +--------------+

</pre>
Notice segment #1 is empty. Empty segments are not returned to
the user, but are kept internally.
<ol>
	<li>()</li>
	<li>(B.0)</li>
	<li>(A.0 - A.4)</li>
</ol>

<h3>Case 4 - Single insert before last</h3>
Insert 1 byte in the middle of the region
<pre>
                +--+
 B =            | 1|
                +--+
                 \ |
       0          \|  5
       +--------------+
  A =  | 1| 2| 3| 4| 5|
       +--------------+

</pre>
Segments
<ol>
	<li>(A.0 - A.3)</li>
	<li>(B.0)</li>
	<li>(A.4)</li>
</ol>

<h3>Case 5 - Single insert at the end</h3>
This type of insert on a normal region is not allowed as index 5 is outside of 
the region's boundarie's. The editable region checks for this condition and
keeps track of appended regions. Once a region has been appended it can not
be removed, only replaced by another region.
<pre>
                      +--+
 B =                  | 1|
                      +--+
                      | /
       0             =+=
       +--------------+
  A =  | 1| 2| 3| 4| 5|
       +--------------+

</pre>
The region will return a single segment, as the insert actually is not allowed 
to happen this way. EditableRegion will add its own segment at the appropriate
time, but that is not what the actual region generated.
<ol>
	<li>(A.0 - A.4)</li>
</ol>

<h3>Case 6 - Double insert in the front</h3>
<pre>
    +--+ +--+
 B =| 1| | 1| = C
    +--+ +--+
     \ |/__/
      \|/              5
       +--------------+
  A =  | 1| 2| 3| 4| 5|
       +--------------+

</pre>
<ol>
	<li>()</li>
	<li>(B.0)</li>
	<li>(C.0)</li>
	<li>(A.0 - A.4)</li>
</ol>

Memory allocation classes. Classes which allocate and manage memory. The main 
class is Malloc class which allocates a large direct buffer from the native
system heap and then manages allocation and free requests from this large
buffer. The Malloc class maintains SoftReferences to the allocated view buffers
and knows when those allocated buffers are freed by the system. They are
appropriately freed up from the internal free list and resued when possible.
